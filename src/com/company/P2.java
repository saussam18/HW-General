     1. C is true
        2. A real world example of a stack is the word undo and redo feature. Real world example of a queue is any line for anything
        3. When you push to a stack, that element is on top and when you pop the item it is the first one off
        4. When you add a queue, you are adding the element to the back. When you remove, you remove the front most element
        5. 3 is returned
        6. 1 is returned
        7. You need to initiate a queue as a linkedlist like this : Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        8. Stack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();
           stack.push("hello");
           stack.push("hi");
           stack.push("goodbye");
           stack.push("howdy");

        9. Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
            for (int i = 100; i >= 0; i -= 2) {
            stack.push(i);
            }

        10. Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<String>();
            q.add("alpha");
            q.add("beta");
            q.add("gamma");
            q.add("delta");
        11. To access the middle elements, you have to remove or pop until you reach them. You should save the other elements you removed so you can use them again
        12. Stacks and queues are very functional because they are simple and because their operations are efficient
        13. Output: [you, are, how]
        14. Output:
            10
            7
            5
            false
            3
            8
            3
        15. Output:
            2
            10
            10
            4
            6
            6
            3
        16. Output:
            a. [1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 2]
            b. [9, 9, 15, 15, 4, 4, -3, -3, 42, 42]
            c. [40, 40, 50, 50, 60, 60, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30]
