    Problem 1: You can utilize a sequential search using a for loop or the built in function Arrays.sort then Arrays.binary search
    Problem 2: It will only look at it less than 1% because the array continually gets cut in half
    Problem 3: A Sequential search due to the point having nor order without a compare to method
    Problem 4: When the array/set of data has been sorted.
    Problem 5: A set of strings will be ordered alphabetical. To change you need to implement a compare to method
    Problem 6: Collections.sort method wont work on a list of point objects since there is no compare to method. Implementing a compare to should fix this problem
    Problem 7: Errors
        1. Compare to implemented in wrong class
        2. CompareTo actual method should take 2 accounts as parameters
        3. Code shouldn't use this
        4. Cannot return the subtraction of 2 doubles in compareTo
    Problem 8: The built in method reverse Order takes the set of data and return the opposite order
    Problem 9: O(LogN)
    Problem 10: O(N)
    Problem 11: O(N^2)
    Problem 12: O(N^2)
    Problem 13: O(N)
    Problem 14:
        1. O(N)
        2. O(N^2)
        3. O(N)
        4. O(N)
        5. O(LogN)
        6. O(N^3)
        7. O(N)
        8. O(N)
    Problem 15:
        1. O(N LogN)
        2.O(N^2)
        3.O(N^2)(LogN)
        4. O(N)
        5. O(1)
